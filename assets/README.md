# Gear images

Add these three image files here so the style tiles show the correct gear:

| File        | Content                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| gloves.png  | Red boxing gloves                |
| shorts.png  | Black boxing shorts               |
| boots.png   | Black high-top boxing shoe (gold)|

The app loads them as `assets/gloves.png`, `assets/shorts.png`, and `assets/boots.png` (relative to `index.html`). If a file is missing, the tile shows the style name (e.g. "Style 1") instead of a broken image.
